                    <p>It has been 1 year and (almost) 2 monthes since <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> became the president of the United States. The heatted discussion about whether he's doing his job well, whether he's suitable
                        for the position and whether he's better than his predecessor keeps going on on the social media.</p>
                    <p>Some of the very first things Trump had done in his presidency were to overturn the last president's accomplishments, while <a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> has been trying hard to hold on to his objectives
                        by attending various political activities since he left the White House, it somehow gives the people the impression that the two are on each other's opposition. There have been many analysis, arguments, opinions and comparison
                        about Trump and Obama in terms of their domestic policies, foreign policies, public image or even family members. However, what's the general public's opinions towards them on social media?</p>
                    <p>In order to get a clear image on the American public social media's feeling on the two presidents, the following twitter sentiment analysis was conducted.</p>
                    <p>First of all, 10000 tweets with "<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%40Barackobama&src=tyah">@BarackObama</a>" and "<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%40realdonaldtrump&src=tyah@realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a> were captured
                        seperatly. Then, the same procudure was done again on each American states of the following: <i>Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina,
                        Texas, Virginia, Washington DC</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>The reason for setting "@" as search words instead of "#" (hashtags) was that, on Twitter, people often use "@" to talk or reply to soembody, while they would use "#â€œ to hashtag certain topic. That is to say, by searching the "@",
                        more direct opinion about the two people could be generated.</p>
                    <p>Looking at the results of the analysis, it's clear that <strong>people generally holds opposite opinions towards them, while the tweets on Dnoald Trump have more sentiment than those on Barack Obama</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Getting 4469 recent tweets on twitter, the word count result shows that winning team and their fans are dominent the social media with various celebrating words and slogan, as the total number of "eagles" and "flyeaglesfly" overrides
                        the number of the rival "patriots".

                    <p>Performace before the match, which has become one of the nation's tradition, was pretty hot on Twitter as well. Singer Justice Timberlake, the words like "performance", "show" and "music" are all visible on the chart.</p>
                    <P>However, part of the reason why Timberlake is a hot word now may because of something else on the performance, this would be explained later with specific tweet.</P>

                    <p>To take a closer look at the differences between the two side of the game one week after the final, below are the word cloud of the tweets that go with hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/patriots?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag">#patriots</a>                        and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23eagles&src=typd">#eagle</a> respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>The tweets with #eagles are more about celebration. The slogan took a great part of all the text tweeted with #eagles. "Champion", "win", "eaglesnation", "best"...words like these were frequently seen.</p>

                    <p>However, the coverage of Super Bowl experienced a sharp decline on 2013, while the other three leagurs' coverage raised since then.</p>
                    <p>Due to the election and heavier global terrorists, year 2016 was a cold time for sports reports in general.</p>
