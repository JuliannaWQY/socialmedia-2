                    <p>It has been almost a week since Philadelphia Eagles won the annual national football game of the US over New England Patriots.</p>
                    <p>After the heated match, the popularity of hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/superbowl?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag">#SuperBowl</a> on Twitter raised 33% from Feb 5th, according to the Twitter hastage
                        analysis page <a href="http://hashtagify.me/hashtag/superbowl"><i>hastagfy</i></a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the most expected and celebreted game in the US as it is, on wonder Super Bowl would draw such big attention on social media, with an overall popularity of the hastage is 74.1 over 100. But since it's been one week already,
                        what are people talking about on social media at this time?
                    </p>
                    <p>Using R to access Twitter API, it's clear that people are still
                        <strong>celebrating the victory and chewing some of the best moments</strong> of this year's game.</p>
                    <hr>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                    <p>Getting 4469 recent tweets on twitter, the word count result shows that winning team and their fans are dominent the social media with various celebrating words and slogan, as the total number of "eagles" and "flyeaglesfly" overrides
                        the number of the rival "patriots".
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, there's no surprise to see "nfl", which is short for The National Football League, the host of the games, to be trendy recently.</p>
                    <img src="img/1.jpg">
                    <p>Given that Eagles belongs to the city of Philadelphia, the winning celebration atomosphere on Twitter becomes more obvious when look at the word cloud of the tweets, with many popular hashtags to be "win", "parade", "philadelphia"
                        and "philly".</p>
                    <p>Performace before the match, which has become one of the nation's tradition, was pretty hot on Twitter as well. Singer Justice Timberlake, the words like "performance", "show" and "music" are all visible on the chart.</p>
                    <P>However, part of the reason why Timberlake is a hot word now may because of something else on the performance, this would be explained later with specific tweet.</P>
                    <img src="img/2.jpg">

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <br><br>
                    <p>To take a closer look at the differences between the two side of the game one week after the final, below are the word cloud of the tweets that go with hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/patriots?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag">#patriots</a>                        and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23eagles&src=typd">#eagle</a> respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>The tweets with #eagles are more about celebration. The slogan took a great part of all the text tweeted with #eagles. "Champion", "win", "eaglesnation", "best"...words like these were frequently seen.</p>
                    <p>The team members who contributed to the victory, like Jason Kelce and Nick Foles, were also mentioned in the tweets as fans cheers for their performance in the game.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, #patriots has few words on the game. Patriot as a word also give the feeds many political phrases and topics on Twitter.</p>
                    <img src="img/chart.jpg">
                    <p>Look as American sports industry as a whole, among the four most popular national leagues, football (Super Bowl) has the biggest attention from the media. The numbers Super Bowl were mentioned on the New York Times were much higher
                        than the rest of leagues, include NBA.</p>
                    <p>However, the coverage of Super Bowl experienced a sharp decline on 2013, while the other three leagurs' coverage raised since then.</p>
                    <p>Due to the election and heavier global terrorists, year 2016 was a cold time for sports reports in general.</p>

                        at the age of 27 in 1992 due to car accident.</p>
